# Web_Crawler_for_Fakebook
Build a web crawler to find hidden message in "popular" social media Fakebook

High-level approach:
For this project, I basically started by setting up the client and connect it with the provided server. Then
,I figure out way to log into Fakebook site using GET and POST method written from scratch. The next and also most 
time-consuming step is to write an algorithm for the web crawler to travel all sites on Fakebook (approximately 10k links)

Challenges:
- A major one is to figure out how to pass in appropriate session id in order to get all the page content.
- How to handle all the status code return by the server
- I encounter the ConnectionRefusedError which I have to handle using try/catch block

Testing:
- Can run the program with the proper command line (stop after retrieving 5 secret flags or not?)
- Try a lot of different print functions just to see how the program supposed to run and debug with
the receiving result.
